--- A set of events that can be listened for using the <code>Event</code> module.

module "core.event"

--- Fired after the game has finished initially loading. This will
--- only ever be fired once per game session. The starting map will be
--- initialized before this is called.
-- @event core.game_initialized

--- Fired after a character has been initially created (but not loaded
--- from a savefile).
-- @event core.character_created
-- @tfield LuaCharacter chara the character that was created

--- Fired after an item has been initially created (but not loaded
--- from a savefile).
-- @event core.item_created
-- @tfield LuaItem item the item that was created

--- Fired after a character is no longer valid for use inside scripts.
-- @event core.character_removed
-- @tfield LuaCharacter chara the character that was removed

--- Fired after an item is no longer valid for use inside scripts.
-- @event core.item_removed
-- @tfield LuaItem item the item that was removed

--- Fired after a character is refreshed. This means various
-- attributes like speed are recalculated. Also, intrinsic character
-- flags (the first 32) will be automatically set from their prototype
-- definitions on refresh. This means that if you want to set a
-- character's intrinsic flag, you have to do so on this event.
-- @see LuaCharacter.set_flag
-- @event core.character_refreshed
-- @tfield LuaCharacter chara the character that was refreshed

--- Fired before a character is damaged. You can change the amount of
--- damage taken by modifying <code>amount</code>.
-- @event core.calc_character_damage
-- @tfield LuaCharacter target the character will be damaged
-- @tfield[opt] Enums.Element element the element type of the damage
-- @tfield Enums.DamageSource|LuaCharacter source the source of the damage
-- @tfield num damage (<b><i>mut</i></b>) the amount of damage

--- Fired after a character is damaged.
-- @event core.character_damaged
-- @tfield LuaCharacter target the character that was damaged
-- @tfield[opt] Enums.Element element the element type of the damage
-- @tfield Enums.DamageSource|LuaCharacter source the source of the damage
-- @tfield num damage the amount of damage

--- Fired after a character was killed. This might not remove the
--- character, because they might revive at some later time (like NPCs
--- in towns). As such, you shouldn't remove the character's data from
--- global storage here.
-- @event core.character_killed
-- @tfield LuaCharacter target the character that was killed
-- @tfield[opt] Enums.Element element the element type of the damage received
-- @tfield Enums.DamageSource|LuaCharacter source the source of the killing
-- @tfield num damage the amount of damage that caused the killing

--- Fired when a character is about to start moving.
-- @event core.character_moved
-- @tfield LuaCharacter chara the character that is moving
-- @usage local GUI = Elona.require("GUI")
-- local Event = Elona.require("Event")
--

--- Fired when a player's turn has just started.
-- @event core.player_turn_started

--- Fired when all characters have finished their actions this turn.
-- @event core.all_turns_finished

--- Fired after a map has been initialized.
-- @event core.map_initialized
-- @tfield bool regenerated true if this map was reset to its initial
-- state on load
-- @usage local Chara = Elona.require("Chara")
-- local Event = Elona.require("Event")

-- Event.register("core.map_initialized", place_characters)

--- Fired before the current map is unloaded.
-- @event core.before_map_unload

--- Fired when all mods have finished loading.
-- @event core.all_mods_loaded

--- Fired when the startup script finished loading. This is only fired
--- when the startup script config option is used.
-- @event core.script_loaded

--- Fired after the main game screen has been drawn. Use this event to
--- draw overlays on the main game screen.
-- @event core.before_ui_render

--- if you want to draw something no matter what is underneath.
-- @event core.before_screen_redraw
