	/Translation Note/
Text written after %xxx,x,EN will be displayed in the English version of Elona.
See /Vernis for example. The translation doesn't have to be precise.
You can even add your own sentences if you like to. 

You can completely ignore the use of {} when translating. (ie. {だ},{だな} )
Those are structures which are used for some Japanese conversions.
They also convert the code into designated in-game variable. 
The codes are listed below.

{player}	player's name
{aka}		player's nickname(aka)
{npc}		the name of the person player is talking to
{me}		"I"
{you}		"you"
{objective}	quest:objective
{reward}	quest:reward
{ref}		quest:refer
{map}		quest:map name
{client}	quest:client name


	/Editing Tips/
* When testing, save your game infront of a NPC and use defLoadFolder. setting in the config.txt to quick load/launch the game.


	/Sunstrike/
I have revised the entire text for consistency with the Japanese, and consistency for storyline, names, etc.  More importantly, I have rewritten all the lines to sound more natural and more original.


	/Lord Nightmare's notes/
The default english vernis translations do not completely match the originals, but this seems to be intentional.
Regardless, I've tried my best to make each line correspond 1:1, but I had to add more information to a few of them.
I'm also having trouble translating a few, google's translator is somewhat lousy. Look for the TODO lines.
BMT means 'bad machine translation'
Also I have no idea where the cyber dome line came from, It doesn't seem to appear in the original text, although it does make sense. I left it, but stuck an extra space before it. I also added an alternative to one of the other lines.

Translated ?hiragana? -> english:
VERUNISU		Vernis
Jors/IERUSU		Yerles
EUDANA			Eulderna
RESHIMASU		Lesimas
YOUIN			Yowyn
DULLFY or DARUFI	Derphy
PARUMIA			Palmia
JABI			Xabi
SUTASHA 		Stersha
NOSUTIRISU      	North Tyris
UU			?Ooh?
KURIMUERU		Crim Ale
NEFIA			Nefia
Shin			??? mybe 'new'
Kita			??? maybe 'north'
DANJO			Dungeon
RUMIESUTO		Lumiest
RAHUAERO		Raphael

Note:
The Yowin, Derphy, Palmia, Noyel and Lumiest texts are added from the user created content on the japanese wiki, as are a few random other lines. The original talk.txt doesn't even have the JAPANESE text for those!

Note 2:
I haven't marked the conversation/personality texts as BMT or whatnot.

Note 3: Personality: whoever translated this originally never sorted the translated lines into the subcategories/personalities where they belong.
I did this whenever I could figure out what was supposed to go where. The ones I couldn't figure out I left at the end.

Note 4: I'm not sure whether I should use ... for ellipsis, or the character meant for that, '・.
Special thanks to gridle for helping with a number of the lines which google translate choked on. babelfish isn't much better.

Welcome to Vernis!
The mines around Vernis have brought a lot of money into our small community.  We are thriving thanks to the mines!
Vernis may just be a coal mining town, but we have a long and notable history.
If I were you, I wouldn't dare play the piano in the bar while Loyter is hanging out in there.  Don't say I didn't warn you.
We're caught in the crossfire of the war between the Yerles and the Eulderna for some time now.
Rumor has it that something of great value has been found in Lesimas.
It seems there is a way to obtain new skills. See the trainer to the east of the town center.
Be careful about carrying too much stuff.  You should sell off anything you don't actually need.
That weirdo near the graveyard? Don't pay any attention to that bum. He's a hopeless junkie and I'm pretty sure he's an alcoholic too.
Miches is nuts about stuffed animals.  She's completely obsessed with collecting them.
The road to the east leads to the capital city of Palmia.
You could bounce a quarter off of Shena's ass.  How does she stay in such great shape?
We've had a lot of trouble with thieves recently.
The people in that live in the Cyber Dome are so strange.  What a bunch of freaks!
Vernis is the only known source of coal in the entirety of North Tyris.  We're making a killing.
You're going to Palmia?  Just follow the road to the east.
Everyone loves Shena's ass.

Ah, there's nothing like the salty smell of the sea breeze.
I love to watch the brutal fights in the pet arena.  You have to be careful though, sometimes audience members catch a stray bullet or get hit by careless dragons.  But you know, the risk is part of the thrill.
Raphael is the enemy of all women.
If you want the best training a fighter can have, you should check out the fighter's guild under the arena office.
The price of seafood cargo is very high farther inland. 
I wonder how you get into that Pyramid north of town.  I have heard of people trying to go there, but none of them ever come back.
I hear that a lot of the seediest and creepiest people head to Derphy.  I'm not sure where that place is, but we seem to get more than our fair share of thieves and vagabonds, so maybe it's not that far from here.

This village is called Yowyn. 
The horses sold here are the finest in the land.
We always seem to be short-handed during the harvest season.  I'm sure everyone in town would be glad to have you lend a hand.
Sometimes we see known outlaws heading to the west after they raid our farms or kill our cattle.  I wonder if something is out there.
Head east out of town, and follow the road north to reach the capital of the Kingdom of Palmia.  Be careful around that old fortress though, it's a strange place.  I've heard sometimes people that go near that place are gunned down by ancient machines that survived from Eyth Terre.
The elder always talks about an old run down castle to the southwest.  That old bag is always making up crazy stories.
Yowyn's economy is pretty small, but we do make excellent caskets.  Sometimes the nobles from Palmia send their squires and servants down here to buy them.
The air is so fresh and lively here in the countryside.  I wouldn't give this up for anything.%END

Welcome to Derphy, a rotten hive of scum and villainy.
Noel is crazy.  She'd bite the head off of a kitten if she had the chance.  She kills things and spreads chaos for the hell of it.  I don't mind a thief, but she's a bit over the top.
A lot of thieves hang out here.  They have a hideout under the casino but they won't just let you in.
Slavery is a very lucrative business.  Many people claim it's evil, but even mighty Palmia's economy would disintegrate if they didn't have any slaves to work their fields.
Nothing beats a bloody match at the arena.  If you want to impress the crowd then give them lots of drama and blood.
Derphy has no city guards, so we can do whatever we want!

%AREA,15,EN			/Palmia
Palmia is huge.  I got lost in this town all the time.  It's really hard to find other people sometimes.
I wonder what's wrong with Mia, she's so weird.  I wish she'd just learn how to talk properly, that'd help a lot.
I can't make out anything that Mia says.
Welcome to the capital of Palmia!  Our kingdom is old and very prosperous.
King Xabi and Queen Stersha are a beautiful couple.
One of our special products here are toys that the nobility often buy for their children.  There are machines in the center of town that sell them, if you can get some coins maybe you can get some awesome toys out of them too.
The etherwinds have been getting strong and more dangerous over the last fifty years.  My grandfather always tells me about how weak they used to be.  If they grow much stronger we might be forced to abandon our homes.
My friend told me there is an ancient fortress to the north.  I wonder if that's true.
We have a lot of parties in Palmia.  The nobility will throw money at any excuse for a drunken celebration.

I hope the weather will recover quickly.
This is about as exciting as a bag of broken rocks.
This shelter was built using contributions by everyone in town.
I appreciate the fact that this shelter is here, otherwise we'd never survive the etherwinds.
We've got a lot of time in here.  We often have to stay in here for days.  I think more than half of our pregnancies begin in here.
This is kind of exciting!
We've got plenty of food stocked up.  We could stay in this place for months if we had to.

It's colder than death's pecker hanging in a well.  But, y'know, welcome to Noyel.
The snow never goes away, but we still have to shovel it so we can get around.
Have you seen that giant near the church?  I heard his name is Ebon.
You can confess your sins at the church.  I can't think of a better way to be forgiven for your crimes.
I'm freezing.  I can't feel my fingers.
A while back I saw a small house south of Noyel.  It looked like some sort of workshop.
Who would build a city here?  And why did I have to be so unfortunate as to be born here?

Welcome to the Holy Night Festival! Enjoy yourself!
The Holy Night Festival is also known as the Festival of St.Jure. This is a feast to honor the Goddess of Healing and to celebrate the end of the year.
I heard Moyer is preparing some showpiece for the festival.
You, have you seen the great celestial statue of Jure yet? Oh, what a beautiful woman she is!
I will meet my lover tonight!
Many tourists visit this town just to see the festival at this time of year.
The Holy Night Festival is an old and historical event. It is said that even the royal family of Palmia used to visit this little town to offer their prayers to St.Jure.
A legend says Jure's tear can cure any diseases. In fact, there have been many witnesses of her miracles in the past events. Such as an old blind woman recovering sight, can you believe it?

Lumiest is a city of great culture and art.  Welcome to our fine city.
I heard there's a town famous for hot springs somewhere.
Here in Lumiest, you can go fishing anywhere you like.  The schools of fish are huge and they never seem to get any smaller.  I wouldn't mind a hamburger from time to time though.
I could talk about painting for hours.
This is where the mage's guild keeps their libraries.  It's the only place in all of North Tyris where you can check out books on even the most obscure spells.
They say something horrible lives in the sewers.  It smells horrific though, so I'd never go down there.

Nothing beats a good old crim ale after work.

It is rumored that the prince of Zanan is planning a massive attack on the Vindale forests.
The ether plague spreads from land to land. It started in the Vindale forest and brought ruin upon the eastern country of Karune. Fortunately, the great central ocean has, to some extent, been protecting us from the winds. I can't imagine any of the  countries in North Tyris would have survived that disaster.
Ah, another adventurer looking for a fortune.
Eh? What do you want?
I hear that South Tyris is a violent and uninhabitable land.  Who knows what sort of horrors lurk there.

If you find adventuring too difficult by yourself, go to Derphy and buy a few slaves to watch your back.
Don't drop items in your shop that you want to keep. They will probably be sold!
You can safely store items in buildings that you own.
If you drop items in a town, the janitors will probably dump them.
Guards will attack you if your karma drops too low.  At least *try* to keep a low profile.
If your pets and allies fall in combat, bartenders in town can bring them back.
Be sure to give good equipment to your allies and pets, since it will make them more effective in battle.
Potions that reverse the effects of the etherwind exist, but they are rare and quite valuable.
If you're planning to buy a building, start with a museum. The maintenance cost is cheap and they start making a profit quickly.
