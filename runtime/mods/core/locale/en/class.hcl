No mere thug, they have knowledge of tactics to bring even the strongest down, and are trained early on to be comfortable in all kinds of armor and shields. Warriors are personifications of the adage \"If violence isn't working, you are obviously not using enough of it.\""

Years of dealing with fences have given the Thief skills with negotiating a better deal. A firm believer in the adage \"What's yours is mine, and what's mine is mine. See that guy over there, his stuff? Mine too.\""

Still, they do have some small skill with staff and short sword. And while they start out so feeble Putits scare them, with a few books under their belt, and a little practice, a Wizard will soon decimate legions. Their motto: \"If it's not on fire now, it will be soon\"."

Good with a polearm from threshing grain, and good bargainers with their deals with merchants, they have working knowledge of just about every trade there is. As such, they never go hungry, as there's always something someone will pay dearly to get done. Their motto: \"Anything worth doing is best done yourself\"."

Skilled with the Short Sword, the axe, and of course all types of bows, plus a few skills they picked up on their long trips in the woods. Firm believers that \"Anything dead over THERE will not be bothering me HERE\"."

Not really a Wizard, not really a Warrior, the Warmage is a believer that stabbing things that are on fire is better than just stabbing them or setting them on fire. Good with swords, armor, books and casting. Their only weakness is that without specialization, they won't truly excel in a field. Still when your motto is: \"Everything worth doing is worth overdoing\", you don't really care."

Oh they can fish, I'll give you that, but if you want a real challenge to build something from the ground up, this is the way to go. After all, you have to teach them everything. Only for those who have a good amount of time to spare. You can even write your own motto if you want."

Still, they can read a book, play a tune, make jewelry, and since they are expected to haul a piano around, they get real good with weight lifting. Their Motto: \"The whole world is my stage!\" And they believe it too."

Good with all armors, shields, divine magic, blunt weapons, and reading. The Priest is a handful, though depending on their God, they may have hidden pratfalls as well. If the motto: \"A hymn a day, will keep me away, Sinner!\" appeals to you, choose this."

Their weapon of choice is the Claymore, hence their name, and they prefer light armor, relying on their great speed and skills of evasion to protect them. They heal fast, but the healing comes at a price. Their bodies are unstable, their motto unknown."
